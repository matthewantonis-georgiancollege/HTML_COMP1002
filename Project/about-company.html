                <p>The Remarkable Journey of Nintendo (1889-1987)
                Founded in 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi, Nintendo has a rich and
                diverse history. What began as a humble playing card company
                in Kyoto, Japan, has transformed into an international gaming
                empire, beloved by millions of fans around the world. The
                following account of Nintendo's journey up until 1987
                showcases the company's unwavering dedication to quality,
                innovation, and entertainment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In its early days, Nintendo Koppai, as it was known then,
                    produced handmade Hanafuda cards. These cards, adorned with
                    intricate artwork, quickly gained popularity across Japan.
                    By 1907, Nintendo had expanded its reach, partnering with
                    the Japan Tobacco & Salt Corporation to distribute its cards
                    nationally.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Throughout the years, Nintendo continued to refine its products
                    and branch out into new markets. In 1953, they adopted
                    modern Western-style playing cards, and by the 1960s,
                    they  began exploring various business ventures,
                    including  instant rice, taxi services, and even love
                    hotels. However, these experiments were short-lived, as
                    Nintendo soon returned to its core business: games and
                    entertainment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1966, Gunpei Yokoi, an assembly line worker, caught the
                    eye of Hiroshi Yamauchi, Fusajiro Yamauchi's grandson and
                    then-president of Nintendo. Yokoi's innovation, the Ultra
                    Hand, was a simple extendable arm toy that became a
                    massive success. This marked the beginning of Nintendo's
                    foray into the world of electronic gaming.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Throughout the 1970s, Nintendo continued to make its mark
                    in the gaming industry, producing popular light gun games
                    like Wild Gunman and various arcade games such as EVR
                    Race. In 1977, the company released its first home
                    console, the Color TV-Game series, in collaboration with
                    Mitsubishi Electronics.<p>
                <br>
                <p>The early 1980s were a pivotal time for Nintendo. In 1980,
                   they introduced the Game & Watch series, a line of
                   handheld electronic games designed by Gunpei Yokoi. These
                   devices featured an LCD screen and a simple control
                   scheme, paving the way for future handheld gaming devices.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1981, Shigeru Miyamoto, a young artist and game designer,
                    created one of the most iconic video games in history:
                    Donkey Kong. This game introduced the world to the
                    now-legendary character Mario, a plucky Italian-American
                    plumber with a red cap and blue overalls. Donkey Kong's
                    immense success propelled Nintendo into the international
                    gaming scene.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Nintendo continued to innovate, launching the Nintendo
                    Entertainment System (NES) in Japan in 1983 and in North
                    America in 1985. The NES revitalized the home video game
                    market, which had been suffering from a crash in 1983.
                    Bundled with the instant classic Super Mario Bros., the
                    NES quickly became a household staple, selling millions
                    of units and solidifying Nintendo's place in the gaming
                    industry.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1986, the release of The Legend of Zelda revolutionized
                    the action-adventure genre. Designed by Shigeru Miyamoto
                    and Takashi Tezuka, this game introduced non-linear
                    gameplay and a rich, immersive world for players to
                    explore. The Legend of Zelda quickly became a critical
                    and commercial success, further establishing Nintendo's
                    reputation for creating captivating and engaging gaming
                    experiences. </p>
                <br>
                <p>By 1987, Nintendo had truly become a global phenomenon.
                    With a lineup of unforgettable games and groundbreaking
                    consoles, the company had captured the hearts of gamers

                    manufacturer to its meteoric rise as a gaming juggernaut,

                    entertainment.</p>
